""" Given an array of N distinct elements, the task is to find all elements in array except two greatest elements in 
sorted order.

Example 1:

Input : 
a[] = {2, 8, 7, 1, 5}
Output :
1 2 5 
Explanation :
The output three elements have two or
more greater elements.   

Example 2:

Input :
a[] = {7, -2, 3, 4, 9, -1}
Output :
-2 -1 3 4

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findElements() which takes the 
array A[] and its size N as inputs and return the vector sorted values denoting the elements in array which have 
at-least two greater elements than themselves.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
3 ≤ N ≤ 105
-106 ≤ Ai ≤ 106   """
