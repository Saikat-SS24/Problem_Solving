""" Given an array arr[]. Push all the zeros of the given array to the right end of the array while maintaining the 
order of non-zero elements. Do the mentioned change in the array in place.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.

Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105 """
