## Bus Conductor

You are conductor of a bus. You are given two arrays chairs[] and passengers[] of equal length, where chairs[i] is the position of the ith chair and passengers[j] is the position of the jth passenger. You may perform the following move any number of times:

- Increase or decrease the position of the ith passenger by 1 (i.e., moving the ith passenger from position x to x+1 or x-1)

Return the minimum number of moves required to move each passenger to get a chair.
Note: Although multiple chairs can occupy the same position, each passenger must be assigned to exactly one unique chair.

## Examples

Input: chairs[] = [3, 1, 5], passengers[] = [2, 7, 4]

Output: 4

Explanation: The passengers are moved as follows:
- The first passenger is moved from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
- The second passenger is moved from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
- The third passenger is moved from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.

Input: chairs[] = [2, 2, 6, 6], passengers[] = [1, 3, 2, 6]

Output: 4

Explanation: Note that there are two chairs at position 2 and two chairs at position 6.
The passangers are moved as follows:
- The first passenger is moved from position 1 to position 2 using 1 move.
- The second passenger is moved from position 3 to position 6 using 3 moves.
- The third passenger is not moved.
- The fourth passenger is not moved.
In total, 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 moves were used.

Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 105

1 ≤ chairs[i], passengers[j] ≤ 104

## Solution

```bash
class Solution:
    def findMoves(self, chairs, passengers):
        # code here
        chairs.sort()
        passengers.sort()
        n, moves = len(chairs), 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            moves += abs(chairs[i] - passengers[i])
        
        return moves
```
