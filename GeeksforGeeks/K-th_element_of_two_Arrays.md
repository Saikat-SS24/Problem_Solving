## K-th element of two Arrays

Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] and an element k, the task is to find the element that would be at the kth position of the combined sorted array.

## Examples 

Input: a[] = [2, 3, 6, 7, 9], b[] = [1, 4, 8, 10], k = 5

Output: 6

Explanation: The final combined sorted array would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The 5th element of this array is 6.

Input: a[] = [1, 4, 8, 10, 12], b[] = [5, 7, 11, 15, 17], k = 6

Output: 10

Explanation: Combined sorted array is [1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17]. The 6th element of this array is 10.

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ a.size(), b.size() ≤ 106
- 1 ≤ k ≤ a.size() + b.size()
- 0 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 108

## Solution

```bash
class Solution:
    def kthElement(self, a, b, k):
        # code here
        arr = []

        for i in a:
            arr.append(i)

        for i in b:
            arr.append(i)

        arr.sort()

        return arr[k - 1]
```
