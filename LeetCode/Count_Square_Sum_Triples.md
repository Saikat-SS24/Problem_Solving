## 1925. Count Square Sum Triples

A square triple (a,b,c) is a triple where a, b, and c are integers and a2 + b2 = c2.

Given an integer n, return the number of square triples such that 1 <= a, b, c <= n.

### Example 1:

Input: n = 5

Output: 2

Explanation: The square triples are (3,4,5) and (4,3,5).

### Example 2:

Input: n = 10

Output: 4

Explanation: The square triples are (3,4,5), (4,3,5), (6,8,10), and (8,6,10).
 
### Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 250

## Solution

```bash
class Solution:
    def countTriples(self, n: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, n):
                x = i * i + j * j
                c = int(sqrt(x))
                if c <= n and c * c == x:
                    ans += 1
        return ans
```
