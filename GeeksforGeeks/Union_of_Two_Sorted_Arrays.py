""" Given two sorted arrays of size n and m respectively, find their union. The Union of two arrays can be defined as 
the common and distinct elements in the two arrays. 

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
m = 5, arr2 [] = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
Output: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Explanation: 
Distinct elements including both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.

Example 2:

Input: 
n = 5, arr1[] = {2, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
m = 5, arr2[] = {1, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 
1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: 
Distinct elements including both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5.

Example 3:

Input:
n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
m = 5, arr2[] = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
Output: 
1 2
Explanation: 
Distinct elements including both the arrays are: 1 2.
Your Task: 
You do not need to read input or print anything. Complete the function findUnion() that takes two arrays arr1[], 
arr2[], and their size n and m as input parameters and returns a list containing the union of the two arrays.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n+m).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n+m).

Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 105
-109 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 109 """
