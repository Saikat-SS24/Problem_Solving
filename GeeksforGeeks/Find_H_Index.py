""" You are given an array citations[], where each element citations[i] represents the number of citations received by the ith paper of a researcher. You have to calculate the researcher’s H-index.
The H-index is defined as the maximum value H, such that the researcher has published at least H papers, and all those papers have citation value greater than or equal to H.

Examples:

Input: citations[] = [3, 0, 5, 3, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are at least 3 papers with citation counts of 3, 5, and 3, all having citations greater than or equal to 3.
Input: citations[] = [5, 1, 2, 4, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 3 papers (with citation counts of 5, 2, and 4) that have 2 or more citations. However, the H-Index cannot be 3 because there aren't 3 papers with 3 or more citations.
Input: citations[] = [0, 0]
Output: 0
Explanation: The H-index is 0 because there are no papers with at least 1 citation.
Constraints:
1 ≤ citations.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ citations[i] ≤ 106 """

        idx = 0
    
        # keep incrementing idx till citations[idx] > idx
        while idx < n and citations[idx] > idx:
            idx += 1
        return idx
