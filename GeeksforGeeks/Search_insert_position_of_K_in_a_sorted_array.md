## Search insert position of K in a sorted array

Given a sorted array arr[] (0-index based) of distinct integers and an integer k, find the index of k if it is present in the arr[]. If not, return the index where k should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

## Examples 

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 6], k = 5

Output: 2

Explanation: Since 5 is found at index 2 as arr[2] = 5, the output is 2.

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 6], k = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: The element 2 is not present in the array, but inserting it at index 1 will maintain the sorted order.

Input: arr[] = [2, 6, 7, 10, 14], k = 15

Output: 5

Explanation: The element 15 is not present in the array, but inserting it after index 4 will maintain the sorted order.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 104
- 103 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 103
- 103 ≤ k ≤ 103

## Solution

```bash
class Solution:
    def searchInsertK(self, arr, k):
        # code here
        for i in range(len(arr)):  
            if arr[i] >= k:  
                return i  

        return len(arr)
```
