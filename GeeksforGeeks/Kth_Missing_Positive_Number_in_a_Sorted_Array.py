""" Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers arr[], we need to find the kth positive number that is missing 
from arr[].  

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: Missing are 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10… and 5th missing number is 9.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: Missing are 4, 5, 6… and 2nd missing number is 5.

Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Missing are 1, 2, 4, 6… and 2nd missing number is 2.

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
1 <= k <= 105
1 <= arr[i]<= 106 """
